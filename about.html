    <h3>What is Philippines known for?</h3>
    <p>Because of the depth of its culture and the splendor of its surroundings, the Philippines is known as Asia's pearl of the Orient. Ancient forts, turn-of-the-century houses, centuries-old churches, and contemporary museums can all be found there.
    </p>
    <h3>Constitutional Republic</h3>
    <p>The Philippines is a constitutional republic with a democratically elected president. The president serves as the nation's head of state, head of government, and chief military commander. A direct election is used to choose the president, who serves a six-year term.</p>
    <h3>Philippine Culture</h3>
    <p>The traditional Filipino and Spanish Catholic traditions are mixed with elements from other parts of Asia and America to create the culture of the Philippines. Filipinos value their families, are frequently religious, and enjoy art, fashion, music, and food.

        Filipinos enjoy having a good time and are friendly people. Together, people will frequently sing, dance, and eat. The annual calendar is jam-packed with celebrations, many of which incorporate pre-Christian nationalism's attire and traditions with modern Catholicism.

        <div class="content-p">
            <p>People have lived in the Philippines since the dawn of human history. Originally, the various islands were populated by competing tribes, each with their own king or queen. In 1521, the explorer Magellan claimed the islands for Spain and colonization began in 1565. Manila was established as the capital of what was then known was the Spanish East Indies in 1571.</p>
            <p>The Philippine-American war between American soldiers and Filipino revolutionaries lasted from 1899-1902 and resulted in US control of the region, during which literacy increased and freedom of religion was introduced, removing Catholicism’s status as the state religion. America’s promises of independence in 1916 led to the Philippines being granted Commonwealth status in 1935.</p>
            <p>Rizal Park in Manila is one of the most politically significant sites in the Philippines. It was the location for the executions of early revolutionaries, the 1946 declaration of independence, and the 1986 rallies of Marcos and Corazon Aquino that led to the EDSA revolution.</p>
